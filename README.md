# MobyViewer
I decided to make this program, when my brother one time requested to make program, that will help speed up his games research. "That program must show quick view of general game information from the site https:\\mobygames.com + show game screenshots(if they are) + may be able to show information by filter and upload info to file". I agreed.

scripts to download games database are placed in /moby/script
they are not completely consistent by we decided not to tide them up for now 

complete binary with database are placed here:

enjoy
